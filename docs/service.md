## Service Flows

### Upload video

Client->>Video Processor API: POST /videos
  Note over Video Processor API,Videos Database: video.status = VIDEO_IMAGE_EXTRACTION_REQUESTED
Video Processor API->>Videos Database: create(video)
Note over Video Processor API,Video Processor Worker: request message for video image extraction must be sent after database persistence
Video Processor API->>Video Processor Worker: publishMessage(MSG_EXTRACT_SNAPSHOT)
```

1. The **client** calls the endpoint to upload a new video: [POST /videos](../docs/api.md#postvideos).
2. The **Video Processor API service** receives the video file along with its metadata:
   - `fileName`: The name of the uploaded file.
   - `fileBuffer`: The binary content of the video.
   - `fileMimetype`: The MIME type of the file (must be `video/mp4`).
   - `userId`: The ID of the user uploading the video.
   - `description`: An optional description of the video.
3. Validates the video file using the `VideoFile` entity:
   - Ensures `fileName` is not null or empty;
   - Ensures `fileBuffer` is not null or empty;
   - Ensures `fileMimetype` is `video/mp4`; otherwise, it rejects the upload with an `InvalidVideoFileError`.
4. A unique video name is generated by appending a timestamp to the original file name:

   ```
   {timestamp}-{fileName}
   ```

5. Uploads the video to an external storage service (AWS S3), storing it under the path:

   ```
   {userId}/{timestamped_video_name}
   ```

   - The external storage returns a `videoUrl` pointing to the uploaded video.

6. Creates a new video record in the database using the `Video` entity, initializing the following fields:
   - `id`: Initially empty, assigned by the database.
   - `createdAt`: The current timestamp.
   - `updatedAt`: The current timestamp.
   - `userId`: Identifies the owner of the video.
   - `name`: The generated unique name.
   - `description`: Provided by the user.
   - `url`: The external storage URL of the uploaded video.
   - `snapshotsUrl`: Initially an empty string (`""`), later updated when video extraction is processed.
   - `status`: Set to `VIDEO_IMAGE_EXTRACTION_REQUESTED`.
7. Attempts to publish a video image extraction request message to the **Video Processor Worker** service with the following structure:

```json
{
  "type": "MSG_EXTRACT_SNAPSHOT",
  "sender": "VIDEO_API_SERVICE",
  "target": "VIDEO_IMAGE_PROCESSOR_SERVICE",
  "payload": {
    "videoId": "string", // The id of the video
    "userId": "string" // The id of the user, received from http header by the client request
  }
}
```

8. If the message publication fails:
   - Deletes the newly created video record from the database.
   - The process terminates with an error response.
9. If everything succeeds, responds to the client with the details of the newly created video.

### **Retry**

If a video image extraction has failed, the system allows retrying the extraction process under specific conditions.

1. The client calls the endpoint to retry image extraction: [POST /videos/{id}/retry](../docs/api.md#postvideosidretry).
2. The **Video Processor API service** retrieves the video record using the `videoId` and `userId`.
   - If the video does not exist or it does not belong to the requesting user (`userId` does not match), the returns an `VideoNotFoundError` error.
3. Validates whether the video status is `VIDEO_IMAGE_EXTRACTION_ERROR`:
   - If the status **is not** `VIDEO_IMAGE_EXTRACTION_ERROR`, the retry request is rejected with an `InvalidVideoImageExtractionStatusError`.
   - This ensures that only videos with a failed extraction attempt can be retried.
4. If the validation passes, the system publishes a new video image extraction request to the **Video Processor Worker service** with the following structure:

```json
{
  "type": "MSG_EXTRACT_SNAPSHOT",
  "sender": "VIDEO_API_SERVICE",
  "target": "VIDEO_IMAGE_PROCESSOR_SERVICE",
  "payload": {
    "videoId": "string", // The id of the video
    "userId": "string" // The id of the user, received from http header by the client request
  }
}
```

5. Updates the video status in the database:
   - The status changes from `VIDEO_IMAGE_EXTRACTION_ERROR` to `VIDEO_IMAGE_EXTRACTION_REQUESTED`.
6. Returns to the client the updated video details, indicating that the retry process has started successfully.

#### Video Processor Worker Extraction Response

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
alt success
  Video Processor Worker->>Video Processor API: MSG_EXTRACT_SNAPSHOT_SUCCESS
  Note over Video Processor API,Videos Database: video.status = VIDEO_IMAGE_EXTRACTION_SUCCESS
  Video Processor API->>Email Service: MSG_SEND_SNAPSHOT_EXTRACTION_SUCCESS
else error
  Video Processor Worker->>Video Processor API: MSG_EXTRACT_SNAPSHOT_ERROR
  Note over Video Processor API,Videos Database: video.status = VIDEO_IMAGE_EXTRACTION_ERROR
  Video Processor API->>Email Service: MSG_SEND_SNAPSHOT_EXTRACTION_ERROR
end
```

### **Handling Video Image Extraction Success Message**

When the **Video Processor API service** receives a success message from the **Video Processor Worker service** indicating that the video image extraction has been completed, it updates the video's status and stores the generated snapshots URL.

1. Receives the success message with the following structure:

```json
{
  "type": "MSG_EXTRACT_SNAPSHOT_SUCCESS",
  "sender": "VIDEO_IMAGE_PROCESSOR_SERVICE",
  "target": "VIDEO_API_SERVICE",
  "payload": {
    "videoId": "string", // The id of the video
    "userId": "string", // The id of the user, that represents the video's owner
    "videoSnapshotsUrl": "string" // The URL that points to the extracted video images location on external storage service (AWS S3)
  }
}
```

2. Retrieves the video record using the `videoId` and `userId`.
   - If the video **does not exist**, an error (`VideoNotFoundError`) is raised, preventing further processing.
3. The video status is updated to `VIDEO_IMAGE_EXCTRACTION_SUCCESS`, indicating that the image extraction has been successfully completed.
4. The `videoSnapshotsUrl` received in the message is stored in the video entity. This URL provides access to the extracted snapshots.
5. Publishes a message to the **Email Service** about the successful extraction with the following structure:

```json
{
  "type": "MSG_SEND_SNAPSHOT_EXTRACTION_SUCCESS",
  "sender": "VIDEO_API_SERVICE",
  "target": "EMAIL_SERVICE",
  "payload": {
    "userId": "string", // The id of the user, that represents the video's owner
    "videoUrl": "string", // The URL that points to the original video location on external storage service (AWS S3)
    "videoDescription": "string", // The video's friendly name given by the user
    "videoSnapshotsUrl": "string" // The URL that points to the extracted video images location on external storage service (AWS S3)
  }
}
```

6. Persists the new status and snapshots URL in the database;
   - This ensures that future queries return the latest video processing status.

### **Handling Video Image Extraction Error Message**

When the system receives an error message indicating that the video image extraction has failed, it updates the video status accordingly and notifies other services.

1. Receives the error message with the following structure:

```json
{
  "type": "MSG_EXTRACT_SNAPSHOT_ERROR",
  "sender": "VIDEO_IMAGE_PROCESSOR_SERVICE",
  "target": "VIDEO_API_SERVICE",
  "payload": {
    "videoId": "string", // The id of the video
    "userId": "string", // The id of the user, that represents the video's owner
    "errorMessage": "string",
    "errorDescription": "string"
  }
}
```

2. Retrieves the video record using the `videoId` and `userId`.
   - If the video **does not exist**, an error (`VideoNotFoundError`) is raised, preventing further processing.
3. The video status is updated to `VIDEO_IMAGE_EXTRACTION_ERROR`, indicating that an error occurred during processing.

4. Publishes a message to the **Email Service** about the failure with the following structure:

```json
{
  "type": "MSG_SEND_SNAPSHOT_EXTRACTION_ERROR",
  "sender": "VIDEO_API_SERVICE",
  "target": "EMAIL_SERVICE",
  "payload": {
    "userId": "string", // The id of the user, that represents the video's owner
    "videoUrl": "string", // The URL that points to the original video location on external storage service (AWS S3)
    "videoDescription": "string", // The video's friendly name given by the user
    "errorMessage": "error message",
    "errorDescription": "error description"
  }
}
```

7. Persists the new status in the database.
   - This ensures that future queries return the error status.
